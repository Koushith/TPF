# Local Installation Guide

This readme file provides step-by-step instructions to install and run a single repository with both the backend and frontend components locally. By following these steps, you'll be able to set up the development environment on your machine and run the application smoothly.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding with the installation, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your machine:

1. Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download it from the official website: https://nodejs.org

## Installation Steps

1. Clone the Repository: Begin by cloning the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Koushith/GitHub-verifed-on-Lens.git
```

2. Install Backend Dependencies: Navigate to the backend directory within the cloned repository and install the required dependencies by running the following command:

```shell
cd backend
npm install
```

3. Configure Backend: Modify any necessary configuration files within the backend directory to match your local environment. Ensure that you set up the correct database connections, API keys, or any other required configurations.

4. Start the Backend Server: Once the dependencies are installed and the configuration is updated, start the backend server using the following command:

```shell
npm start
```

5. Install Frontend Dependencies: Navigate to the frontend directory within the cloned repository and install the required dependencies by running the following command:

```shell
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

6. Configure Frontend: Modify any necessary configuration files within the frontend directory to match your local environment. Update any API endpoint URLs or other relevant configurations if needed.

7. Start the Frontend Development Server: Once the dependencies are installed and the configuration is updated, start the frontend development server using the following command:

```shell
npm start
```

8. Access the Application: After the frontend development server starts, you can access the application by opening your web browser and visiting the provided local URL. The application should now be up and running on your local machine.
